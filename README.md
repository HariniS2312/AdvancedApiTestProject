# Advanced API Testing

## Purpose
This project implements API testing using TestNG and RestAssured. The initial tests focus on verifying basic API responses (e.g., status codes), and later improvements will involve enhanced response validation and error handling.

## Temporary Solutions
- The `testPostRequest` verifies only the status code of a POST request to the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Future improvements will include validating the response body and handling different response scenarios.
